# The burger app 
## this app is a prototype of an e-commerce app i am still working on.
## i can say it is 85% completed as i'll need to add a few more pages for checking out and data recieeving form
## i can say all the features of react, react-router, redux amongst others were employed in the building of this app

## upon loading, the app recieves some ingredients from firebase api and update price amount thereafter. users then have the luxury of adding or removing the ingredients according to their taste and pocket size

## the price value is being updated as they remove and adds ingredients and are then asked to fill some form before finally making the purchase just to get a few information about them and send or ask for feedback if need be
